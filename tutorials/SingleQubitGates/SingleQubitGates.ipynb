    "This tutorial introduces you to single-qubit gates. Quantum gates are the quantum counterpart to classical logic gates, acting as the building blocks of quantum algorithms. Quantum gates transform qubit states in various ways, and can be applied sequentially to perform complex quantum calculations. Single-qubit gates, as their name implies, act on individual qubits. You can learn more at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate).\n",

You can apply a gate to a qubit by [multiplying](../LinearAlgebra/LinearAlgebra.ipynb#Matrix-Multiplication) the gate's matrix by the qubit's state vector.

    "All quantum gates are reversible - there is another gate which will undo any given gate's transformation, returning the qubit to its original state. \n",
    "This means that when dealing with quantum gates, information about qubit states is never lost, as opposed to classical logic gates, some of which destroy information. \n",

It sets up a series of quantum states, and then shows the result of applying the $X$ gate to each one. To run the demo, run the next cell using `Ctrl+Enter` (`⌘+Enter` on a Mac).\n",

    "In the previous tutorial we discussed that the qubit state in Qiskit cannot be directly assigned or accessed. The same logic is extended to the quantum gates: applying a gate to a qubit modifies the internal state of that qubit but doesn't return the resulting state of the qubit. This is why we never assign the output of these gates to any variables in this demo - they don't produce any output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying several gates in a row follows the same principle. In the mathematical notation applying an $X$ gate followed by a $Z$ gate to a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is denoted as $Z(X(|\\psi\\rangle))$, because the result of applying a gate to a state is another state. In Qiskit, applying a gate doesn't return anything, so you can't use its output as an input to another gate - something like `Z(X(q))` will not produce expected result. Instead, to apply several gates to the same qubit, you need to call them separately in the order in which they are applied:\n",
